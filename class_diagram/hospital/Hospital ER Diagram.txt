Hospital ER Diagram

 Assumptions:
1. Each patient can undergo multiple tests/examinations.
2. Each examination is conducted by exactly one doctor.
3. A doctor may conduct zero or more examinations.
4. Patients and doctors are uniquely identified by their respective IDs.
5. Each examination record stores date, type, result, and notes.

Constraints:
1. Examination is modeled as an entity linked to both Patient and Doctor.
2. A patient can have no tests (e.g., upon initial registration).
3. An examination must be associated with both a patient and a doctor.
