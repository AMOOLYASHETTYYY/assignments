Registrar's Office ER Diagram

Assumptions:
1. A course can have multiple prerequisites (including none).
2. A course offering is uniquely identified by course number, year, semester, and section number.
3. A student may enroll in multiple course offerings over time.
4. Each enrollment results in a grade (possibly nullable before grading).
5. A course offering may be taught by one or more instructors.
6. A student cannot enroll in the same course offering more than once.

Constraints:
1. "Enrolls" is a many-to-many relationship with a relationship attribute `grade`.
2. "Teaches" is a many-to-many relationship between Instructor and CourseOffering.
3. Prerequisites are modeled as a recursive many-to-many relationship on Course.
4. A course must have at least one offering to be active.
